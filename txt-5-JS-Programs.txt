5 JavaScript Programs

Assignment: 
Find 5 examples of JavaScript programs or user interface components like a slide show or calendar date picker. 
Write why you like them and identify which one you think you could make with your current understanding of 
programming in general, even if you don�t know how to program in JavaScript.

1.	BaroqueMe: http://baroque.me/
Program: Entire page.

The developer created a beautiful, interactive page that combines music, animation and input. The lines change
size with the music as these white balls pass through them in a circular motion to strum them while leaving a 
faint white trail. The user can mouse over the balls and control the speed of them, vibrating the strings as they 
pass while also distorting the sound and trails with your input. The other balls on the screen keep rotating to 
keep the music going if you decide to hold a ball captive under your mouse (just by hovering and not clicking 
on it). If you hold it down and drag you take control of all the balls on the screen and can drag them as a group, 
taking full control over the speed of the music. I like it because it�s fun, entertaining, oddly relaxing, and 
implemented beautifully. 

2.	Deluge Studios: http://www.delugestudios.com/
Program: Main slideshow.

The slideshow changes when you click on the checkboxes below it, switching over very quickly between three 
different slideshows that the user can choose from.  As the slideshow moves, each slide has a hyperlinked 
text that slides out with the image. I like this particular slideshow because it creates a wonderful way to manage 
three distinct categories of information, presenting many large graphic images without having to sacrifice simplicity 
and easy navigability. Most other slideshows typically don�t have multiple slideshows that occupy the same space 
in the layout. They are usually very linear and the functions are typically limited to jumping to a slide by 
clicking on a thumbnail, or toggling backwards and forwards through all of the images. Perhaps they�ve created 
a program that can filter out particular slides depending on user input.
 
3.	Pixel Slave: http://pixelslave.com/
Program: Entire index.

This developer modularized the index page into sections that appear one by one. I have mixed feelings about this 
but I�m still mentioning it because it looks neat and I would like to figure out how to do it. That said, I think 
that it takes a good graphic designer to keep it from getting too cluttered. Though they have made sure that all of 
their primary links are displayed first for immediate access, I still feel a small degree of impatience when I visit 
the site a third time or more. There�s something uncomfortable about just seeing a block and 5 links and clicking 
on one of them before waiting for the rest of the page to load. This tends to be my thought process when I access 
the homepage: �What if I�m missing something? I�ll just wait. Nope, everything is just the same as it was before.� 
I do it every time.

4.	Nofrks.com : http://www.nofrks.com/#home
Program: Sliding transition between pages. 

So cool! The site slides about when you navigate between pages. I would love to learn how to do this. I�ve seen 
something like this before but I think that their site is well designed (graphically speaking). Beyond just the 
amazing JavaScript effect, I enjoy the way they�ve designed the site to work with it. Though it�s under maintenance, 
I can already see that they�re utilizing space very well and that navigating through it will be easy and enjoyable.

5.	JavaScript Ants: http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~irush/projects/ants.html
Program: Ants crawling all over the page, and ant control panel at the bottom.

I found a site that mentioned how to create these ants in JavaScript as a teach-yourself-JavaScript online exercise. 
I think it�s categorized under intermediate. I really want to make this, and I think that I can make this if I plug 
away at it for some time. The student who implemented it on the above posted page has already given me a glimpse of 
the problems that I will likely encounter. Though it�s just and exercise, I can see how laboring through something 
like that will help me grasp the basics of animation in JavaScript. I also enjoy watching the ants accumulate all 
over the page.
