research a problem

develop a structure

-reduce the possibility of mistakes/problems.
-good practice to rewrite you programs to see if you can make it more
efficient.
- tracers: experiments.
- minimAlly viable : meets the requirements at the most basic level.
- first objective: if you run the model and test for the first problem:
      - efficiency, scalability, *do not repeat yourself. If you think you
	might need to repeat yourself, then you have a problem.
1. Don't repeat yourself
2. Denormalization: if you can make it faster by 

- diff between dynamic and static type
- dynamic: more chance for logical errors with auto conversions of types.
- start to pull together an idea for a project.
- use Google JS Styleguide: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml
- JS Lint: JavaScript 'validator'
- Design patterns: A blueprint (algorithm) to programs.
- makes problem solving easier.
- Chain of command: Decides what should be done.
	- series of if or case statements.
	- parameter comes in, gets checked by a number of if or case statements
	  to evaluate it and send it to proper processing.
- 3 different types of design patterns:
	- Creational Design Patterns
	- Structural Design Patterns
	- Behavioral Design Patterns
- Dynamic programming: 
- Reduce the number of times you use an if statement for the sake of simplicity
- Reflection: Allows you to determine the properties of an object by mirroring it.
- Document object: where all the data is. The DOM is the document, html is the rendered view of the view. 
- if you change something in the model the view changes.
- you can manipulate objects in the DOM/ manipulate the DOM.

example: 

var div = document.getElementById('header');
var a = document.createElement('a');

a.textContent = 'click me'; 
a.href = 'http://www.google.com';
div.appendChild(a);
div.setAttribute("class", "green");

- text content is literal.
- The DOM is an array of objects.
- Tags: Everything is either an object or a property of an object

Duck Punching: Adding a method or property to an exisiting reserved word in
a language (array, function, etc).

- understand implement keyword.
- prototype is an object that acts like a class.
- typeof: test type of object.
- flyweight vs decorator: flyweight uses the same base to dynamically 
create objects, decorator adds to an instantiated object. 
- 3js: 3d library that's javascript

Course progression:
1. Event binding
2. Exception handling
3. Unit testing
4. JavaScript Libraries
	- jQuery
	- backbone js
	- 3js
- Next 4 weeks: Project
- 

3JS
- Event binding: Telling the observer what to look for.
- Call back: if statement without an if (this event is going to happen, run this function)
- functions that are being passed when an event happens.
- call backs can end up in a que or in a cache when events are happening too fast to be processed.
- call back stack is like a cache.
- jQuery on() method: 
- cross compatibility issues with javascript event binding. use jQuery.
- http://api.jquery.com/on/
- event binding .on()
- $("p").on("click", function(){
	alert($(this).text());
